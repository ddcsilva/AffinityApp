# 💞 AffinityApp

**AffinityApp** is a modern fullstack relationship platform built with **.NET 8 (Web API)** and **Angular 17**, designed as a study project to learn and apply real-world development techniques using microservices-friendly patterns, clean architecture, and modern frontend tools.

This project is part of my journey to master fullstack development and demonstrate practical skills in API design, authentication, state management, and responsive UI/UX.
