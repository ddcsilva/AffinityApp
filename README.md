# üíû AffinityApp

**AffinityApp** is a modern fullstack relationship platform built with **.NET 8 (Web API)** and **Angular 17**, designed as a study project to learn and apply real-world development techniques using clean architecture principles and a modular structure.

This project is part of my journey to master fullstack development and demonstrate practical skills in API design, authentication, state management, and responsive UI/UX.
